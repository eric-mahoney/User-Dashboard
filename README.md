## Javascript API Dashboard
User dashboard created in vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

The dashboard has three main cards that are populated with information from various APIs such as:

- Random photos of cat provided by: https://thecatapi.com/
- Random cat facts provided by: https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/
- Weather data provided by: https://openweathermap.org/api
- News data provided by: https://newsapi.org/

## Project Status

This project is currently on hold but I would like to revisit it. In the future, I would like to:

- refactor the code and make it a bit more clean and managable.
- allow users to control which APIs they see on their dashboard and certain settings in them (for example, seeing news vs not seeing news, and the selecting which news stories to see).
- allow different color schemes for the user to select.
- possibly convert the code into a React application.

## Reflection

This was a personal project for me over last summer when I was getting more serious about learning JavaScript and wanted to make an actual, usable application. Previously I had only used JavaScript for simple things like changing colors or creating a dropdown menu. For this project, I learned about ES6's fetch API for getting json data, and then processing the json data once it's returned. I also learned about using HTML5's geolocation API for getting the user's current location and other information.
